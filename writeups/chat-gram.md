Hence, looking at the image more closely, it is possible to see that a ferris wheel is present over the lake. Searching in Google `Chatgram ferris wheel lake` indicates an amusement park called Foy's lake amusement world, in a city called `Chittagong` in Bangladesh.

Using Google Street View along the lake it is possible to locate the "gentleman" and the two characters: Donald Duck and a frog.
